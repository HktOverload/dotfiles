Config files

To manage them, `reg.txt` specifies which files here map to which files on the actual system, and `syncconfig/` contains a simple Haskell program to sync them. This can be called using the `dfchk` bash script. 

This is mostly just for fun, but `dfchk` is managed by `dfchk` (it's in `reg.txt`).
